                    <ul>

                    <li class="lead">Core Competencies (320 hours)</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Prepare the dining room /restaurant area for service</li>
                        <li>Welcome guests and take food and beverage orders</li>

                    </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>Like most technical-vocational programs, the Food and Beverage Services NC II program follows a
                    modular type of instruction. Modular Instruction is a type of teaching method that follows a
                    specific set of planned learning activities and exercises. These activities are contained in a short
                    booklet called a module. Students are allowed to proceed with their own learning pace (self-pacing).
                    Instructors provide timely feedbacks allowing students to improve their skills.</p>
                <p>Lessons in this program are taught to students through lectures and demonstrations, self-paced
                    instruction and group discussion. Student learning assessment and evaluation is conducted at the end
                    of every module discussion. This is done through direct observation, simulations, practical
                    demonstrations and oral and written exams</p>
