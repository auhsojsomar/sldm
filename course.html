                    of instruction. Modular Instruction is a type of
                    teaching method that follows a specific set of planned
                    learning activities and exercises. These activities are
                    contained in a short booklet called a module. Students
                    are allowed to proceed with their own learning pace
                    (self-pacing). Instructors provide timely feedbacks
                    allowing students to improve their skills.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Lessons in this program are taught to students through
                    lectures and demonstrations, self-paced instruction and
                    group discussion. Student learning assessment and
                    evaluation is conducted at the end of every module
                    discussion. This is done through direct observation,
                    simulations, practical demonstrations and oral and
                    written exams
